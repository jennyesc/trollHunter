JavaScript Game

This game was created for our first JavaScript class in the Technical Web Design program at BCIT. When the game was created, it being responsive was not a requirement, so that is the only downside to the game and why I did no include it with my portfolio.

Object of the game is to hit the troll with a mushroom. The trolls with randomly change and mushrooms are dropped by hitting the spacebar. You can move the player by using the arrow keys on the keyboard. Left is slower, Right is faster and then up and down. 

This game was created based on a basic tutorial, where a plane would hit random rectangles (targets) with bombs. I made changes to include the intro/instruction screen, randomize the trolls, change the image once the troll was hit ("boom") and for the game over screen to appear at the end of the game.
